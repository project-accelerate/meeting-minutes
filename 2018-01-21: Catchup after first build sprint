Chris & Pete in attendance


Agenda
===

* Reviewing the wireframes and build progress so far.

* Discussing how to time development of version 1 (should we do it now or wait for more developers to commit time)

* If necessary, define the next build tasks and add them to Github.

* If necessary, discussion of code review, testing and acceptance process.

* Discuss how and when to start publicising and beta-testing the app.


Discussing
===

Reviewing the wireframes and build progress so far.
---

* Pete: Needs to be more information on the front. Isn't clear that you can change your location, for example.
Maybe change location should be outside the box.

Chris: Stronger call to action?

Chris: Examples of sites we could pinch call to action from?

Pete: Take call to action and entry box out of hero.

Chris: Should we add a splash screen explaining what it does?

Pete: Agree.

Pete: Needs a name too.

Chris: Agree.

Next actions:

* Add a splash screen with some copy explaining the functionality, move call to action and controls out of hero unit.

* Emphasis on not just meetings, community actions as well (ties in with Labour focus)


Discussing how to time development of version 1
---

Chris: I'm happy to work on this by myself for now. Danger with me doing all the development now is that it becomes harder
for other people to get involved. We can mitigate this by ensuring that we peer-review code and have conversations in the open as much as possible.

Pete: It's difficult to get people interested without having something to show.

Actions:

* Continue development

* DM developers who previously expressed an interest.

* Require peer review of code 

* Add a wiki to project with information about 


If necessary, define the next build tasks and add them to Github.

Pete added some tasks to Github


Discuss how and when to start publicising and beta-testing the app.

Deferring this for now.


Other Suggestions
===

* Chris: Organise an Accelerate meetup? Might be a good way of building the community around the project.
Could do eg. one in London, one in Manchester (based on locations of people involved on the Slack channel)
